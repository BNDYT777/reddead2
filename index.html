Always ideal, this character never betrayed the gang members, with friends and siblings. Beautiful beyond this character. This character was influential, leaving a lasting impact. It’s the character of Morgan, the legendary cowboy. Initially portrayed as bad, but she proved her strength and resilience. She faced pressure and challenges head-on. A character worth discussing and appreciating.”</Em></P>

<P>“Oh, Arthur Morgan! When she was truly bad, she never lacked intelligence. She followed only the gang leader, Dutch van der Linde. Her character was all about wanting to kill, following a specific character or the gang leader. But then came the illness, tuberculosis, and it changed her life completely—upside down. She became more considerate of those around her, thinking logically about their lives. Oh, Arthur Morgan, the cowboy’s tale.”
